"""MQTT integration seam shared by the Renault-platform add-ons: the broker client, its
connect/message/disconnect callbacks, and Home Assistant MQTT-discovery publishing. Owns the
topic topology (state/attributes/availability/command topics) and the location-publish policy.

Per-model identity and the discovery tables are injected by the add-on via ``configure(catalog)``
at startup — this module imports the config leaf only, never an add-on module. ``configure`` reads
from the passed catalog:
  * ``NODE`` — the HA discovery node / topic root (e.g. "alpine_a290" / "renault_5");
  * ``DEVICE`` — the HA device block;
  * ``OBJ_PREFIX`` — the object_id prefix stripped to form value_template keys / command suffixes;
  * ``DIST_UNIT_OBJS`` — the sensor object_ids whose unit follows the locale (mi/km);
  * ``MQTT_KEEPALIVE`` — the broker keepalive (optional, default 60);
  * the discovery tables ``SENSORS`` / ``BINARY_SENSORS`` / ``ICONS`` / ``ACTION_BUTTONS`` /
    ``NUMBERS`` / ``OPTIONAL_ENDPOINTS`` / ``RETIRED_SENSORS`` / ``DEFAULT_DISABLED_SENSORS`` and
    the endpoint names ``SOC_ENDPOINT`` / ``REFRESH_LOCATION_EP``.

The one edge that would otherwise point back at the add-on's poll loop (an inbound command must run
the add-on's async run_command on the event loop) is inverted via injection: the add-on sets
``mqtt._LOOP`` and ``mqtt._COMMAND_HANDLER`` at startup and ``_on_message`` calls the injected
handler — so the dependency stays one-directional with no cycle.

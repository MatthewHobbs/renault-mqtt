"""Debug API-dump seam shared by the Renault-platform add-ons.

The one-shot `debug_dump` diagnostic: fetch the readable endpoints once per restart, redact
identifiers/secrets from the raw payloads, and log the lot at WARNING. Split out of the poll loop
so it stays lean and the redaction logic sits next to the dump it protects.

Imports only the config leaf (`cfg` + `_config_secrets` + the injected `ENV_PREFIX`), so it has no
cycle. `_debug_redact` here is the *structural* key/value scrubber for decoded API payloads —
distinct from config.redact, the substring scrubber for arbitrary log strings; the dump uses both
(config's secret list feeds this module's value masking).

Per-model variation: the `debug_dump` option name is read under config.ENV_PREFIX, and an add-on
may register extra per-model probes via EXTRA_SPECIALS (e.g. the Renault 5's raw `alerts` GET,
which the A290 does not expose). The no-arg method list and the redaction key-set are shared.

# No-arg readable telemetry endpoints. Excludes get_contracts and get_notification_settings —
# those carry contact / account PII with no sensor-mapping diagnostic value.
#
# get_location WAS excluded on the same grounds and was added back on 2026-09-06, because the
# premise turned out to be wrong on both halves. It does have diagnostic value: an A290 sat on
# a lastUpdateTime of 2026-09-02T11:43:14Z for four days while every other endpoint polled
# healthily, and there was no way to see what the location endpoint was actually returning —
# the one misbehaving endpoint was the one the dump could not show. And the PII objection is
# already handled structurally rather than by omission: gpslatitude / gpslongitude / latitude /
# longitude are in _DEBUG_REDACT_KEYS and are masked by key regardless of which endpoint
# produced them, so what survives into the log is lastUpdateTime and gpsDirection — a timestamp
# and a heading, which is exactly the diagnostic signal and none of the position. A test pins
# that: if the coordinates ever stop being redacted here, it fails. Includes ones a given model forbids (charge-mode, pressure,
# lock-status, res-state, hvac-history, hvac-sessions) so the dump documents the full
# supported/forbidden picture. Date-ranged endpoints (charges, charge-history) are probed
# separately below — they can't be called arg-less.
